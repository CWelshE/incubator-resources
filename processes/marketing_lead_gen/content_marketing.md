# Content Marketing

Here at Codelitt Incubator, we believe the best marketing we can do is to provide real value through education. We have a team full of experts from software engineering, web applications, mobile applications, machine learning, artificial intelligence, user experience design, user interface design, and product management. We believe in externalizing as much of our knowledge as we can; for our customers, our communities, and our future employees. 

Our open source and open education ethos have been founding principals of our company. Some of our largest and most valued customers have started conversations with us because of our educational posts. A rising tide, lifts all boats. 

# Process:

This document serves as a deep dive into the different considerations. Please read through this doc before getting started. However, these steps should all be completed and tracked in Pipefy. The Pipefy workflow will help you make sure you’ve completed everything below. Here is a broad overview of the process before we dive in:

1. Idea

2. Writing (Includes the goal and content)

3. Approval (Go through these steps before you ask for approval)

4. Publish (Includes publishing AND after you publish)

5. Published (Tracking metrics)

# Blog

Our blog is probably the main location where we post our content. We have tagged sections that are geared towards our different audiences, for example our [Corporate-Ed tag which contains content geared towards educating our corporate partners. ](http://www.codelitt.com/blog/tag/corporate-ed/)Here is the process for each post:

# The Idea (step 1)

We keep a list of ideas in Pipefy.com. When you’re in the shower, laying awake at night, etc, and an idea comes to you - WRITE IT DOWN. Later on, add it to Pipefy or Trello. Some ideas, you won’t follow through on, but they’re good inspiration for later. If you don’t write them down or put them into the pipeline, it’s likely the day-to-day will distract you and we could lose valuable content. 

# The Content (step 2)

## The Goal

Every post should have a goal. Don’t start writing without some goal in mind. Here are some examples:

1. Educate <audience category> on <insert subject here> (Probably the most common for us)

2. Provide an overview on <insert subject, tech, etc, here>

3. Provide insights on <insert subject, tech, etc, here>

4. Discuss the problems of <insert subject, tech, etc here>

5. Show <audience category> process of <insert subject here>

6. Announce X

Be specific with your goals. Ideally, your goal will have the audience it is directed at, what you aim to provide the audience with in your post, and even could include what action you would like the reader to take. 

## The Content

Make an outline based on your goal and then start writing. Give yourself a precise time to write it just as you would schedule a meeting with someone else. Block out time so it can’t be taken by something else. When you are done, READ IT OUTLOUD to someone else. This will help you catch many typos and poorly structured sentences. 

### Here is how to get started on our blogging platform:

1. Get an invite for the blog. Ask Cody. These will be posted under YOUR name to give proper credit. 

2. Include a photo in your profile on the blog

3. Click "New Post"

4. Title is at the top

5. Tags are in the black bar at the bottom. Make sure to tag appropriately. Explore tags of other posts. Add anything that is relevant. Some distinct tags you MUST include are:

    1. startup-ed - if geared towards educating startups

    2. corporate-ed - if geared towards educating our corporate partners

    3. educational - if it’s either one

6. Settings for SEO stuff like the URL, metadata, etc are in the "gear" button on the bottom left. URL should include all the important, non-filler words of the title. Metadata description field should entice the searcher to click. 

7. An image for the top of your post is located here in the "gear" button menu as well

8. Post content is edited in markdown.[ Here’s an overview. ](https://blog.ghost.org/markdown/)

### Here are some guidelines for your content:

1. Include a header photo. We have a premium subscription to DeathToTheStockPhoto.com. [Here is another list of great locations](https://medium.com/@dustin/stock-photos-that-dont-suck-62ae4bcbe01b#.z76numv79) to source images that don’t infringe upon any rights and are actually well produced (as opposed to terrible stock photos). 

2. Beyond a header image, remember that graphs, infographics, and other images often do a great job of helping explain a point and breaking up a wall of text. 

3. Your title should be descriptive and enticing

4. Your first paragraph should be to the point and explain you goal in the post (possibly background). The point of the first paragraph is to demonstrate that the rest of the article is worth a read. 

5. Break content up with H2/H3 tags (`##` and `###` in markdown respectively). This makes it scannable, helps organize the content, and increases usefulness

6. Don’t be an echo chamber. Say something original. 

7. Add a subscribe form from Mailchimp SPECIFIC TO THE LIST for which the content serves. See [Email lists below](#email-lists) for more detail. 

# Approval (Step 3)

This is pretty chill. Just make sure you’ve checked all of the boxes and made sure 

# Publish (Step 4)

### Some guidelines for after you post (sharing content):

1. Add to Buffer (ask for password details). This will share it across Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn

2. Send out to our subscribers. Below is an overview on [sending updates out via Mailchimp](#sending-out-updates-to-subscribers) when we have new content. 

3. Send to people you know that will find it useful. 

4. Add link to forums WHERE IT WILL BE FOUND USEFUL. We are ANTI-spam here. For example, a non-technical intro will not be appreciated by a very technical forum. A corporate education piece will not be useful to a startup crowd, etc. A few examples of different places where our content does quite well are:

    1. Hacker News

    2. Reddit (depends on content and subreddit)

    3. Product Hunt (when we release new products)

    4. Innovation Groups 

5. Don’t be part of the problem (spam). If you’ve written great content, then it will stand on its own legs. 

## Sending out updates to subscribers

1. Sign into Mailchimp. 
2. Click Create Campaign
3. Select Regular Campaign
4. Select which list to send to. Learn more about [list segments](#list-segments) below
5. Fill out all necessary fields. Your subject should be informative, probably similar to the title of the post itself.
6. Make sure to click the Google Analytics link tracking box and name it something reasonable. Click next. 
7. Click Saved Themes and select the theme called BlogPosts
8. Make sure to change the content and photo to match your post (don't forget the small summary at the top)
9. Confirm and send! 

# Newsletters

We don’t do many. We are going to start with Ahead of the Curve though, given that we come up with a better name. 

## Ahead of the Curve Newsletter

# Email lists

Our lists are aggregated from people who sign up on our blog or that we have done business with && have told us they would like to receive updates. 

*We do NOT purchase lists or send unwanted emails. Any employee caught doing this, will be reprimanded and made to fix his grievance of the affected people. This aligns with our general company value of not being evil.*

## List segments

The lists below contain information about the type of people who should be added to this list IF they’ve requested to receive updates either personally or signed up on the blog. 

* Startups - Investors, employees/founders of startups, and people who work in the startup community.

* Tech - This is a highly technical list. People either work very integrated with technology to the point they know what `null` means or are engineers themselves. 

* Design - These are normally people working in the design industry, work closely with design, or generally benefit from knowing a great deal about design. 

* Innovation - This list is largely people working in the innovation, R&D, or skunkworks departments of companies. The types of posts they generally go for are our "corporate-ed" and other high-level posts which serve to educate larger organizations on new technologies, agile processes, and startup methodologies for achieving greater disruption. 

## Adding to the lists

A vast majority of the people on our lists are because they’ve subscribed via the embedded form on a blog post (see the Guidelines for content section), however, when you’re speaking to people about Codelitt Incubator and our educational efforts and someone seems genuinely interested, ask them if they’d like to receive updates when we add new posts. You can simply:

1. Login to mailchimp

2. Click "Lists" at the top

3. Select the list(s) most appropriate for that person

4. Click the "Add subscribers" button 

5. Add their details

6. Select checkbox that they’ve given you permission (And they most certainly have better given you their permission)
