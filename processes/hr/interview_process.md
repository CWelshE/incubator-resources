Interview Process
======================
Are you nervous?

Don't be! 

## Philosophy
We believe that people are the most important part of a company. A very talented team with people who are truly passionate about what they do, is the foundation for a great product. 

## The process
The process should be very lean and should allow the candidates to have a direct contact with the team he/she would be working with. We look for skilled and interesting people. It's important to bring strong technical knowledge, but it's as important to bring more than techincal knowledge to the table.

#### We need to know you

This will be the first interview.

* Basic info
* Experience
* What do you like to do?
* What makes you different?
* What can you bring to our team?
* What are you passionate about? What causes do you advocate for? (Open source, net neutrality, freedom to puppies, etc)

#### Let's get practical (Engineering team)

This will be your second interview.

* Show us what you can do
  * Do you have an amazing work to show?
  * Do you have any code sample?
  * No? That's fine, we work through some code problems with each potential hire.

During the technical interview, we are not going to be asking you to recite obsure things from memory. What we are looking for are your problem solving skills. You are free to google anything you'd like. If you don't know the answer or how to solve it, that's alright. Talk us through your thinking and how you would go about solving a problem.
