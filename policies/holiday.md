Paid and unpaid holiday
========================

Starting your first year, you are given 2 weeks of paid vacation. Second year, you are given 3 weeks of paid vacation. Vacation time resets annually. If you start mid-year, vacation is pro-rated (e.g. If you start Q4, .25 * 2 weeks of paid vacation is allotted). 

Please give advance notice so we can account for the time you will be out of the office and shift workloads. We do not guarantee any vacation time with less than 2 weeks advance notice. 1 month advance notice is preferred because it is helpful for the team to plan for your absence and smiley faces are given. 

While we do not monitor the hours that you work and you're free to set your own schedule, taking time off for holiday without notification could result in a [Concern Report.](../processes/hr/employee_concern_report.md)

There are no limit to sick days unless and abusive pattern becomes prevalent.
